# React Setup

## NPM?
NPM (Node Package Manager) allows developers to download, install, update, and manage the libraries or “packages” required for building websites and applications. NPM comes with Node.js, and all installed packages are listed and managed through a file called package.json.

## Package.json
package.json is an important file that defines and describes a Node.js project. It includes key details such as the project’s name, version, dependencies, scripts, and other metadata. 
This file is generated automatically when a Node.js project is created and it serves several purposes :
* It lists all installed packages
* It stores essential project information
* It provides scripts that can be executed (such as starting the development server)
*  It ensures that others can install the exact same dependencies using npm install.

## Vite
Vite is a modern frontend build tool designed to create fast and efficient web development projects. Developers prefer Vite because it offers an extremely fast development server, automatically refreshes the browser whenever code is updated, and has a simple, easy-to-set-up configuration. It is commonly used with frameworks such as React, Vue, and also works with plain JavaScript (Vanilla JS).





<!-- # React + Vite
# React * Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two offic    ial plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is enabled on this template. See [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) for more information.

Note: This will impact Vite dev & build performances.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
